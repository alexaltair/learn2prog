This repo is an experiment in using GitHub as a tool for projects _other_ than code.

Pull requests are very welcome!

For each of my goals, I try to have a plan, a strategy for how I will accomplish it. This often results in lots of notes, lots of hierarchical lists, and lots of changing. It also includes me tracking how things go, noticing what's wrong, and trying ways to fix it.

I'm hoping GitHub can help with these things.

There are a couple main features of GitHub that I won't be taking advantage of. One is all the things that make GitHub great for group collaboration; I'll be doing this project on my own. The second is using it as an archive; I'll almost never need to revert a commit.

The goal I've chosen for this experiment is the most appropriate one; the goal of learning how to program. This will help me maximize the worth-whileness of the experiment.

The folder structure is a little weird here. This is part of the experiement. The folder heirarchy describes the goal heirarchy. Lower folders describe ways to achieve the higher folder goal. Inside every folder (except bottom ones) is a file called `justification.md` which describes how the inner folders achieve the outer folder. Inside a few bottom level folders is a file called `next.md`. This file describes the next action I will take, within the current week, to achieve the goal represented by that folder. At the end of that week, I will go through all those files. If I achieved the action, I will update it to reflect the action for the next week. If I didn't achieve it, I'll file an issue. I'll reflect on what went wrong, and come up with some better way to achieve it the next week. I'll update the file to reflect this. When I check the next week, if the goal was achieved, I'll close the issue. Otherwise I'll iterate.
