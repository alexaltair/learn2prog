This repo is an experiment in using GitHub as a tool for projects _other_ than code.

For each of my goals, I try to have a plan, a strategy for how I will accomplish it. This often results in lots of notes, lots of hierarchical lists, and lots of changing. It also includes me tracking how things go, noticing what's wrong, and trying ways to fix it.

I'm hoping GitHub can help with these things.

There are a couple main features of GitHub that I won't be taking advantage of. One is all the things that make GitHub great for group collaboration; I'll be doing this project on my own. The second is using it as an archive; I'll almost never need to revert a commit.

The goal I've chosen for this experiment is the most appropriate one; the goal of learning how to program. This will help me maximize the worth-whileness of the experiment.

The folder structure is a little weird here. I'm not using folder to organize collections of files; I'm using them as a place to put ideas in a heirarchy. There should be files under some of them; for instance there should be .c files in the "Learn C" folder. This is part of the experiement.
