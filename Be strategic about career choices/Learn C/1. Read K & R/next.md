For the week of 11 November 2013

Learn the basics of C by reading through K & R for around two hours. Do the exercises you come across. Become comfortable with the workflow of using the compiler.

Remember to do this by putting a flexible block on your google calendar. Most likely put in the time after work; possibly on the weekend.
