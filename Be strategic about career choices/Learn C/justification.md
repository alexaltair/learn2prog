Everyone says K & R is the C book to read. Though, everyone cites some problems it has. If anyone knows of a really great C book, feel free to file an issue!

I've been recommended project Euler a hundred times. It's a pre-made set of exercies to practice a language. It's based on math problems, which fits both my background and what I will use C for. It's perfect!
