As described in "What I want from my software career", there are a lot of factors that contribute to choices I might make. I think much of the question comes down to what technologies I learn. (This is an empirical question that I could be very wrong about; if anyone thinks there are other very important things, please file an issue here!) Two major considerations here are;

1. How relevant this is to understanding AI

This question narrows things down quite a bit more. The kind of AI I care about are the ones whose research may lead to AGI. These will likely deal with highly parallel algorithms, and tons of data. They may also deal with very different low-level tools. I think learning C will give me the best foundation to learn or create whatever tools are relevant here. Learning how to exercise databases will help with the data. Other "big data" tools, like Hadoop, may be useful later; but I will wait until I know the tried-and-true technologies before diving into more modern ones.

2. How employable this makes me.

Any skills in software will leave me employable. But different technologies will give me different opportunities in terms of types of companies, types of teams, what other technologies I will work with, how much money, et cetera. I believe both C and Postgres are incredibly employable skills.
