Half the skills I will need are mathematical, and half of them are empirical.

For the mathematical half, I will need to be able to understand algorithms and what they do. I'll need to be able to understand them enough to implement them, and enough to deduce their implications.

For the empirical half, I'll need to understand the nature of current computational technology. I'll need to know what algorithms are reasonable to implement, and what the economic tradeoffs are when it comes to time, money, effort, et cetera.
